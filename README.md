## Inspector

An inspector similar to _Invision_ or _Zepplin_ that allows you to get all the required measurements in a convenient way. Just open [index.html](/inspector/index.html) in your browser.

## Sketch

If you have _Sketch_ installed it might be even more convenient to directly open the [sketch file](/sketch/Challenge.sketch).
